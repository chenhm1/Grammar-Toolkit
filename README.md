# Garmmer-Toolkit
The toolkit, implemented in Java, supports sentence generation with coverage criteria, sentence enumeration and sentence analysis for context-free grammars.

## Usage

Jre 6 (Jre1.6) is required, which is available at http://java.sun.com/.
The toolkit can be used as a Java library or an application.
As a library, it would be added into classpath.

or be used from the command-line:

   javaw -jar Toolkit.jar or java -jar Toolkit.jar.
